      <h3>Artist's Statement</h3>
      <p>I have spent countless summers in the remote north woods of Ontario; the rocks, water, weathered sheds and people of the isolated back lakes have become a natural part of my internal geography. That rugged, spare world constantly plays against the places I travel to and draw in: Vermont, Catalina, the San Juan Islands, France, South Africa, Alaska and Algonquin.</p>

      <h3>Influences</h3>
      <p>The artists I follow, look to and am undoubtedly influenced by would have to include Donald Evans (staring for many years at his images in the brilliant book about his work), Francesco Clemente, Eva Hesse, Joseph Cornell, Jonathan Borofsky, Jennifer Bartlett and last, but assuredly not least, David Hockney (when I saw what he could do with the Brushes app, I got one!).</p>
